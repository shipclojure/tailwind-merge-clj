## Acknowledgements

Full credit for the implementation goes to the [Original Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) and the author [Dany Castillo](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge).

This is a rewrite of the same implementation logic in `cljc` to better support server side rendering from JVM.
