# tailwind-merge-clj

Merge Tailwind CSS classes without style conflicts for Clojure(Script)

## Usage
```clojure
(require '[twmerge.core :as t])

;; Get the current time
(t/twmerge "w-xl w-[100px]") ;; => "w-[100px]"
(t/twmerge "px-2 py-1 bg-red hover:bg-dark-red p-3 bg-[#B91C1C]")
;; => hover:bg-dark-red p-3 bg-[#B91C1C]

```

-   Supports Tailwind v3.0 up to v3.4
-   Works in all modern browsers and JVM env

## Installation

To include one of the above libraries, for instance `ring-core`, add
the following dependency to your `deps.edn` file:

    com.shipclojure/tailwind-merge-clj {:mvn/version "0.1.0"}

Or to your Leiningen project file:

    [com.shipclojure/tailwind-merge-clj "0.1.0"]

The package is available on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.shipclojure/tailwind-merge-clj))

## Features

Works both on clojure & clojurescript runtimes so it can be used to SSR from JVM with a tool like [Uix](https://github.com/pitch-io/uix)


See [tests](./test/twmerge/core_test.cljc)

## What is it for?

See [Original's library doc for what it is for](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/blob/main/docs/what-is-it-for.md)

## Limitations

See [original's limitations](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/blob/v2.5.2/docs/limitations.md)

## Acknowledgements

Full credit for the implementation goes to the [Original Tailwind Merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge) and the author [Dany Castillo](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge).

This is a rewrite of the same implementation logic in `cljc` to better support server side rendering from JVM.
